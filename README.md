### 🔄 9. Nested Loops
<p>In programming, a loop is used to repeat a block of code until a specified condition is met. The while loop controls flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given boolean condition.</p>

### 🗃️ 10. Arrays
<p>Build a strong foundation of knowledge in Java programming! In this lesson, we take a look at arrays and how to use them! We shall learn how to define and initialize and array, to to access its elements, how to read and print arrays, and basic array algorithms.</p>

### 📌 11. Methods
<p>In this lesson, we will review another very important paradigm in the programming universe – methods. We will find a few ways in which will make our code more organized and readable. Also, we are going to learn how to extend the functionality of our code. We shall learn how to define and invoke methods and how to use parameters and return a value.</p>

### 📋 12. Lists
<p>Lists are one of the most popular data structures in programming, as they allow for flexibility. Unlike arrays, their length is not fixed and you can insert and delete elements at any point. In this lesson, we shall learn how to use lists in Java, how to define and initialize list, how to access its elements, how to add, edit, delete and insert elements, how to read, print and traverse lists.</p>

### 🗺️ 14. Maps, Lambda and Stream API
<p>Build a strong foundation of knowledge in Java programming! In this lesson, we take a look at maps, lambda expressions, and the stream API in Java. We shall learn how to map keys to values, how to process sequences of elements (streams) and how to filter, transform, sort and aggregate the elements.</p>

### 🧱 15. Objects and Classes
<p>This lesson provides a great overview of objects and classes if you are a beginner on the topic. With it, you will make your first steps in the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which is one of the most widely-used programming paradigms in modern programming. 

By the end of the lesson, you will be familiar with the objects and class work and their purpose. You will also know the different parts of a class – methods, constructors, getters and setters, fields, etc.</p>
