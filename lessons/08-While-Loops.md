<h1 align="center">8. While Loops</h1>

#### 1. Lesson Summary

In this lesson, we continue with the <strong>Java Basics Tutorial</strong>.
A <strong>While Loop</strong> is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given <strong>boolean</strong> condition. The <strong>While Loop</strong> can be thought of as a repeating if statement.
In the expression, we have to test the condition. If the condition evaluates to <strong>true</strong>, then we will execute the body of the loop and go to <strong>update </strong>the expression. After executing the loop body, this expression increments/decrements the loop variable by some value. Otherwise, we will exit from the <strong>While Loop</strong>.
<span >How does <strong>While Loop</strong> execute?</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span >Control falls into the <strong>While Loop</strong>.</span></li>
 	<li><span >The flow jumps to the condition</span></li>
 	<li><span >The condition is tested.</span>
<ol>
 	<li class="ql-indent-1"><span >If it is <strong>true</strong>, the flow goes into the body.</span></li>
 	<li class="ql-indent-1"><span >If it is <strong>false</strong>, the flow goes outside the loop</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li><span >The statements inside the body of the loop get executed.</span></li>
 	<li><span >The <strong>update</strong> takes place.</span></li>
 	<li><span >Control flows back to Step 2.</span></li>
</ol>
<span > The <strong>break statement</strong> ends the loop immediately when it is encountered. The <strong>break</strong> statement is usually used with a <strong>conditional</strong> statement inside the loop.
</span>

Both <strong>While</strong> and <strong>For Loops</strong> repeat a block of code. We use For Loops when we preliminary know the number of iterations. If we don't know when the exit condition will be met, we use <strong>While Loops</strong>.
