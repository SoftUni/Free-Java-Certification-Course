<h1 align="center">3. Console-Based Input and Output</h1>

#### 1. Lesson Summary
In this lesson, Svetlin Nakov teaches how to read and work with console-based **input** and **output**. Learn how to read strings and numbers from the standard input and how to format and print text, numbers and other data to the standard output.

The console is the **terminal** window that is running the Java program. I.e., that's the terminal window where you type in the command java **ProgramName**. When a Java program starts running, the **Java runtime system** will initialize many variables in support of the running program.

Svetlin Nakov demonstrates several ways to use a **console** for user **input** and **output** in **Java**. Learn how to use the **console API** in **Java**: **java.util.Scanner, System.out, System.out.print(), System.out.print()** and **System.out.printf()** with placeholders.
