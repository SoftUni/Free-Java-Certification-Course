<h1 align="center">14. Maps, Lambda and Stream API</h1>

#### 1. Lesson Summary

<span>In this video we go in depth explaining <b>maps, lambda and the stream API</b>. All of these three topics are <b>extremely important</b> for every beginner programmer to learn as they are part of the pillars of programming, just like the rest of the topics in the current course.</span>
<span>By the end of the lesson, you will be familiar with three different types of maps in Java - <b>the HashMap, the LinkedHashMap and the TreeMap</b>. All have their special traits and serve a specific purpose, which George explains very well.</span>
<span>Then you will dive deep into <b>lambda expressions</b> and see how important they are when we are doing certain operations with maps.</span>
<span>Finally, George will touch up on another <b>important topic when it comes to maps</b> - <b>the Stream API</b>, which provides many <b>methods for easy querying </b>of a collection.</span>
