<h1 align="center">16. Defining Classes</h1>

In the current lesson, you will learn the foundations of <b>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</b>.

Svetlin Nakov will go over the topics of <b>defining simple classes</b>, <b>conventions, </b>and <b>best practices</b> in doing so, <b>creating objects</b> of these classes, <b>object references</b>, and what is <b>the difference between an object and a class</b>.

Later on in the lesson, you will become familiar with <b>data fields</b> and <b>access modifiers</b>, and of course - <b>constructors, getters, and setters</b>, which are <b>the building blocks of every class</b>. By the end of the lesson, you will also have a good understanding of the term <b>static</b>, which you've surely encountered multiple times so far.
