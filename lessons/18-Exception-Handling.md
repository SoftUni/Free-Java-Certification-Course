<h1 align="center">18. Exception Handling</h1>

#### 1. Lesson Summary

In the current lesson, we take a close look at <b>exception handling </b>and<b> why it's important</b> in software engineering.

What are exceptions? We've all seen one, there is no way to write completely bug-free code. In short<b> an exception is</b> <b>a problem that arises during the execution of the program</b>.

Exceptions <b>simplify code construction</b> and maintenance and allow problematic situations to be <b>processed at multiple levels</b>.

In Java <b>exceptions are objects</b>. The base for all exceptions is the <b>Throwable class</b> - it contains information about the <b>cause </b>of the exception, its <b>description</b>, and the <b>stack trace</b>.

There are<b> two types of exceptions</b> - <b>checked </b>(also known as compile-time exceptions), and <b>unchecked </b>(also known as runtime exceptions).

Exceptions can be handled by the <b>try-catch</b> construction. The <b>try-finally </b>block is also used, especially when we want to <b>ensure the execution of a given block</b> of code.

To <b>raise an exception</b>, we use the <b>throw </b>keyword. When an exception is thrown <b>the program execution stops</b>, and the<b> execution travels over the stack</b> until <b>a matching catch block </b>is reached to handle it.
