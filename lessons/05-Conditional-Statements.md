<h1 align="center">5. Conditional Statements</h1>

#### 1. Lesson Summary
In this lesson, we continue with the Java Basics Tutorial. A<strong> conditional statement</strong> is a piece of code that checks the given <strong>condition</strong>, and when it is <strong>true</strong>, the code related to it is performed. It is used to make decisions based on the <strong>conditions</strong>. <strong>Conditional statements</strong> execute when there is <strong>no condition</strong> around the statements. If you put a <strong>condition</strong> for a block of statements, the execution flow may change based on the result evaluated by the <strong>condition</strong>. This process is called <strong>decision-making</strong>.
<p><span ><strong>Conditional statements</strong> begin with the keyword <strong>if</strong> followed by parentheses. An expression is placed inside the parentheses, then evaluated when the<strong> conditional statement</strong> is reached. </span></p>
<span ></span>

<span >The parentheses are followed by a block, which is defined inside opening <strong>{</strong> and closing<strong> }</strong> curly brackets. The source code inside the block executes if the expression inside the parentheses evaluates to </span><strong>true</strong><span >. If the expression in the <strong>conditional statement</strong> evaluates to <strong>true</strong>, the execution of the program progresses to the block defined by the <strong>conditional statement</strong>.</span>

On the other hand, if the expression evaluates to <strong>false</strong>, the execution moves on to the statement after the closing curly bracket of the current <strong>conditional statement</strong>. Using the <strong>else</strong> command, we create an alternative option for when the <strong>conditional expression</strong> evaluates to <strong>false</strong>. In the case of multiple <strong>conditions</strong>, we can use the<strong> else if </strong> command. <strong>else if</strong> is like <strong>else</strong>, but with an additional <strong>condition</strong>. It follows the <strong>if-condition</strong>, and they may be multiple.

To sum it up,<strong> conditional statements</strong> are something that you must learn if you want to continue developing as a programmer. They s are specified by a set of statements having boolean expressions which, are evaluated to a boolean value <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>. <strong>Conditional statements</strong> help us to make a decision based on certain <strong>conditions</strong>.
