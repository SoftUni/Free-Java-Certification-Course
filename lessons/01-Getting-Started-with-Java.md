<h1 align="center">1. Getting Started with Java</h1>

#### 1. Lesson Summary
In this lesson, Svetlin Nakov explains what **coding** is, what **commands** are and what is their syntax in Java. He teaches how to write simple **Java commands** and **Java programs**, and how to **run the Java code** and see the execution results.

Together we will solve a few **coding exercises** to practice the new skills from this lesson. We shall use a **free online code editor** called **repl.it**, so you need nothing more than your laptop. It is recommended to **use a laptop** instead of a tablet or smartphone, because it works better.

Finally, the instructor shows you how to use the **SoftUni Judge**, our automated code evaluation system and how to submit your code for automated grading.
