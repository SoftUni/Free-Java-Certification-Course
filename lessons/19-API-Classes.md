<h1 align="center">19. API Classes</h1>

#### 1. Lesson Summary

<p>In the current lesson, we take a closer look at the most frequently used <b>Java API classes</b>. Svetlin Nakov will explain all about the Math class, how to generate random numbers, the need of <b>BigInteger </b>and <b>BigDecimal </b>in programming, and how to work with date and time in <b>Java</b>. We will also look at two of the main <b>Java classes</b> - <b>Arrays </b>and <b>Formatter</b>.</p><p>The <b>Math </b>class contains methods for performing basic numeric operations, such as <b>round, min, max, abs, ceil, etc</b>.. The <b>Arrays </b>class contains various methods which facilitate array manipulation. <b>String.format()</b> allows us to return the formatted string by given <b>locale</b>, <b>format</b>, and <b>arguments</b>.</p><p>In this lesson you will find many helpful <b>examples </b>and <b>exercises</b>, so make sure to <b>practice </b>what you've learned! That's the only way to grasp the concept at hand.</p><p><b>BigInteger </b>and <b>BigDecimal </b>are used for handling <b>large </b>and <b>small numbers</b> with <b>great</b> <b>precision</b>. <b>BigInteger </b>will throw an exception when the result is <b>out of range</b>. <b>BigDecimal </b>gives the user <b>complete control </b>over the rounding behavior. Importing a single package allows us to work with the <b>date </b>and <b>time API</b>. </p>
