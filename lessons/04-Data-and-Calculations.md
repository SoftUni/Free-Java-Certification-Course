<h1 align="center">4. Data and Calculations</h1>

#### 1. Lesson Summary

Data types specify the different sizes and values stored in a variable. There are two types of data in Java:

* **Primitive data types**
* **Non-primitive data types**
 

To start, we will be using these data types only:

**int** –  holds a wide range of non-fractional number values.<br>
**double** – only takes up to 8 bits of memory<br>
**boolean** – can contain only two values: true or false.<br>
**char** – is a symbol representing a Unicode-encoded character.<br>
**String** – is a sequence of characters<br>
 

Besides printing them on the console, we can use them for various arithmetic operations. The table on the right shows different types of arithmetic operations. All of them are the same as the arithmetic operations you have learned in school.

These may seem like simple operators, but when correctly, used they can be of help on more complex projects.
