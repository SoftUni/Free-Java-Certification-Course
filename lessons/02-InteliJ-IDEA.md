#### 1. Summary

In this lesson, Svetlin Nakov talks about development environments (IDEs), which are used by developers to **write**, **compile**, **run** and **debug code**. He will teach you how to use **IntelliJ IDEA**, the most popular **IDE** for Java developers. He will show you how to install **JDK** (Java development kit), how to install and run **IntelliJ IDEA**, how to create a console-based app, how to write code, how to use the auto-complete to speed up coding, how to run your programs and even how to debug your code. In the video Nakov will show you how to create new **Java** project, choose the project type, give a name for the project, create a class with a **“main”** method, write some code in it, and finally, run the project.
